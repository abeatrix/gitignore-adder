# Gitignore Adder

This extension allows you to add selected directory or file to the `.gitignore` easily.

## Features

- Create a `.gitignore` file with a single command
- Add selected directory or file to the `.gitignore` by right clicking on the file name in the file explorer
- Add current open file to the `.gitignore` by right clicking on the editor
- Run on all VS Code editors, including VS Code web editors

> Tip: If a `.gitignore` file does not exist at root when adding a file / directory, a new `.gitignore` file will be created at root automatically.

## Development

* `npm install`
* make changes
* debug via F5 (Run Web Extension)
* reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window to check your changes.
